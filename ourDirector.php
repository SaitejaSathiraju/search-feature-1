                <br /> <b>Dr. Prakash Chauhan</b> obtained his Post Graduate Degree in Applied Geophysics from University of Roorkee (now Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee) and Ph. D. in Physics from Gujarat University, Ahmedabad. Prior to joining National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad, he was the Director at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), Dehradun since April 2018. He joined Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1991 at Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad as scientist and since then working for the applications of Space Technology including Remote Sensing technology for Geosciences, Atmospheric and Oceanic process studies, Natural resources management for ocean and land resources. He initiated research activities for planetary remote sensing to study solar system objects mainly Earthâ€™s Moon and Mars, through Indian planetary missions.
              </p>
              <p class="p-style"> His major achievements are in the area of Earth Observation Applications including development of algorithms for ocean colour parameter retrieval, aerosol remote sensing for space-based air quality monitoring, climate response to various ecosystems and disaster risk reduction. He has done lead work in using the hyperspectral satellite data for Indian Planetary Missions such as Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-1 for lunar surface composition mapping. He had been the Principal Investigator for Infrared Imaging spectrometer (IIRS) instrument on-board Chandrayaan-2 mission. His work on Chandryaan-2 IIRS spectrometer data has resulted in unambiguous detection of H2O and OH on the surface of the Moon.
